# Mastro

A work-in-progress project. This repo currently focuses on clear, incremental progress tracking and lightweight decision records while we shape the roadmap and architecture.

## Documentation
- Progress log: `docs/PROGRESS.md`
- Decision records: `docs/DECISIONS.md`

## Contributing & Workflow
- Make small, focused edits.
- Every meaningful change should:
  1) Update `docs/PROGRESS.md` with an entry (date, summary, scope, next steps)
  2) Reference or add an ADR to `docs/DECISIONS.md` if it reflects a decision
  3) Use a descriptive commit message

## Getting Started (TBD)
- Tech stack selection and project scaffolding are pending. See open items in `docs/PROGRESS.md`.
