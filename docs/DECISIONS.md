# Decisions (ADRs)

Lightweight Architectural Decision Records. Newest first.

## ADR-0001: Adopt progress and decision logs
- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2025-08-08

### Context
We need transparent tracking of changes and clear rationale for decisions while the project is still forming.

### Decision
- Use `docs/PROGRESS.md` for incremental change logs
- Use `docs/DECISIONS.md` for ADRs in a simple in-repo markdown format

### Consequences
- Low overhead documentation with high visibility
- Enables consistent onboarding and historical context
- Adds a small discipline requirement to each change
