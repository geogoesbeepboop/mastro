## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### API Key Problems
```bash
# Error: OpenAI API key not configured
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
# or
mastro config:init  # Interactive setup

# Verify configuration
mastro config --show
```

#### Git Repository Issues
```bash
# Error: Not in a git repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Error: No staged changes
git add .  # Stage files first
mastro commit
```

#### Performance Issues
```bash
# Large repository analysis is slow
mastro commit --no-cache  # Skip caching for large changes
mastro explain --max-commits=5  # Limit analysis scope

# Enable debug logging
MASTRO_DEBUG=true mastro commit
```

#### Token Limit Errors
```bash
# Error: Token limit exceeded
# Solution: Mastro automatically handles this with intelligent compression
mastro explain --format=json  # Check compression details

# For very large changes, consider splitting commits
git add file1.js && mastro commit
git add file2.js && mastro commit
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable verbose logging
export MASTRO_DEBUG=true
mastro commit

# Check cache status
mastro cache --status

# Validate configuration
mastro config --validate
```

### Getting Help
```bash
# Command-specific help
mastro commit --help
mastro review --help
mastro pr create --help

# General help
mastro --help

# Version information
mastro --version
```

## ✨ Best Practices

### Commit Workflow
```bash
# 1. Make focused changes
# Work on single feature/fix at a time

# 2. Stage intentionally  
git add specific-file.js  # Not git add .

# 3. Review before committing
mastro review --actionable-only

# 4. Generate intelligent commits
mastro commit

# 5. Learn from good commits
mastro commit --learn  # On approved commits
```

### Code Review Integration
```bash
# Before creating PRs
mastro review --persona=security --strictness=strict
mastro review --format=markdown > self-review.md

# For complex changes
mastro explain --impact --audience=technical
```

### Performance Optimization
```bash
# Enable caching for repetitive operations
# (enabled by default)

# For large repositories
mastro commit --no-cache  # When needed
mastro explain --max-commits=10  # Limit scope

# Use appropriate output formats
mastro review --format=json  # For automation
mastro explain --format=markdown  # For documentation
```

### Security Considerations
```bash
# Never commit sensitive data
mastro review --persona=security  # Always check

# Use project-specific configuration  
# Keep API keys in environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."  # Not in config files

# Regular security reviews
mastro review --persona=security --actionable-only
```
