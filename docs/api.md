# Mastro API Documentation

## Overview

The Mastro API is designed to facilitate seamless interactions with the Mastro project, a comprehensive tool for analyzing and managing files in a Node.js environment. Built with TypeScript, the API emphasizes clarity, maintainability, and ease of integration. 

### Design Principles

- **Modular Architecture**: The API is structured into distinct modules, each responsible for specific functionalities, promoting separation of concerns.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Where applicable, asynchronous functions are utilized to enhance performance and responsiveness.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling mechanisms are in place to ensure robustness and reliability.

## Authentication and Authorization

Currently, the Mastro API does not require authentication or authorization. All endpoints are publicly accessible. Future versions may introduce authentication mechanisms to enhance security.

## Detailed Endpoint Documentation

### 1. File Analysis

#### `scanRecursive`

- **Signature**: `const scanRecursive = (currentPath, basePath = '') =>`
- **Method**: GET
- **Description**: Recursively scans files in the specified directory.

**Example Usage**:
```javascript
const { scanRecursive } = require('mastro/lib/analyzers/doc-analyzer');

scanRecursive('/path/to/directory')
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

### 2. Command Operations

#### `operation`

- **Signature**: `operation: () =>`
- **Method**: POST
- **Description**: Executes a predefined operation.

**Example Usage**:
```javascript
const { operation } = require('mastro/lib/base/command');

operation()
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

### 3. Exit Handling

#### `exitHandler`

- **Signature**: `const exitHandler = async () =>`
- **Method**: POST
- **Description**: Handles cleanup operations before exiting.

**Example Usage**:
```javascript
const { exitHandler } = require('mastro/lib/commands/analytics');

exitHandler()
  .then(() => console.log('Cleanup completed'))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

### 4. Directory Reading

#### `readDirRecursive`

- **Signature**: `const readDirRecursive = async (dir) =>`
- **Method**: GET
- **Description**: Reads all files in a directory recursively.

**Example Usage**:
```javascript
const { readDirRecursive } = require('mastro/lib/commands/flow');

readDirRecursive('/path/to/directory')
  .then(files => console.log(files))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

## Request/Response Schemas

### Request Schema

For operations that require input, the request schema is defined as follows:

```json
{
  "path": "string",
  "options": {
    "recursive": "boolean"
  }
}
```

### Response Schema

The response schema for successful operations is:

```json
{
  "status": "string",
  "data": "any"
}
```

## Error Handling and Status Codes

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests:

- **200 OK**: The request was successful.
- **400 Bad Request**: The request was invalid.
- **404 Not Found**: The specified resource was not found.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: An unexpected error occurred.

### Error Response Example

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Invalid path provided."
}
```

## Rate Limiting and Usage Guidelines

Currently, there are no rate limits imposed on the Mastro API. However, users are encouraged to implement their own throttling mechanisms when making multiple requests to avoid overwhelming the server.

## SDK/Client Library Information

The Mastro API can be accessed directly via HTTP requests or through the provided client library. The client library simplifies interactions with the API and handles common tasks such as error handling and response parsing.

### Installation

```bash
npm install mastro
```

### Basic Usage

```javascript
const Mastro = require('mastro');

// Example of using the client library
Mastro.scanRecursive('/path/to/directory')
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

## Code Examples in Multiple Languages

### JavaScript Example

```javascript
const { scanRecursive } = require('mastro/lib/analyzers/doc-analyzer');

scanRecursive('/path/to/directory')
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

### Python Example

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('http://api.mastro.io/scanRecursive?path=/path/to/directory')
print(response.json())
```

## Testing and Development Guidelines

To ensure the reliability of the Mastro API, developers are encouraged to follow these guidelines:

1. **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for each function to validate functionality.
2. **Integration Testing**: Test the API endpoints to ensure they work as expected.
3. **Documentation Updates**: Keep the API documentation up to date with any changes in functionality or usage.

For local development, clone the repository and run the following command to start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will allow you to test the API endpoints locally.

## Conclusion

The Mastro API provides a robust and flexible interface for file analysis and management. By following the guidelines and examples provided in this documentation, developers can easily integrate with the API and leverage its capabilities in their applications. For further assistance, please refer to the project's GitHub repository or contact the development team.
