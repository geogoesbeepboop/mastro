# Mastro API Documentation

## Overview of the API Architecture and Design Principles

The Mastro API is designed to facilitate seamless integration with various components of the Mastro project. Built using TypeScript and Node.js, the API adheres to RESTful principles, ensuring that it is stateless, cacheable, and provides a uniform interface. The architecture emphasizes modularity, allowing developers to extend functionality easily.

### Key Design Principles:
- **Modularity**: Each component is designed to handle specific tasks, promoting reusability.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Where applicable, operations are designed to be non-blocking, enhancing performance.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling mechanisms are in place to provide meaningful feedback to users.

## Authentication and Authorization

Currently, the Mastro API does not require authentication or authorization for accessing its endpoints. However, future versions may implement token-based authentication to secure sensitive operations.

## Detailed Endpoint Documentation

### 1. `scanRecursive`

- **File**: `lib/analyzers/doc-analyzer.js`
- **Signature**: `const scanRecursive = (currentPath, basePath = '') =>`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Description**: Scans the directory recursively from the specified path.

#### Example Request
```javascript
const result = scanRecursive('/path/to/directory');
console.log(result);
```

#### Response Schema
```json
{
  "files": ["file1.js", "file2.js"],
  "directories": ["dir1", "dir2"]
}
```

### 2. `operation`

- **File**: `lib/base/command.d.ts`
- **Signature**: `operation: () =>`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Executes a predefined operation.

#### Example Request
```javascript
const result = operation();
console.log(result);
```

#### Response Schema
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Operation completed successfully."
}
```

### 3. `exitHandler`

- **File**: `lib/commands/analytics.js`
- **Signature**: `const exitHandler = async () =>`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Handles cleanup operations before exiting the application.

#### Example Request
```javascript
await exitHandler();
```

#### Response Schema
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Cleanup completed."
}
```

### 4. `readDirRecursive`

- **File**: `lib/commands/flow.js`
- **Signature**: `const readDirRecursive = async (dir) =>`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Description**: Reads a directory recursively and returns its contents.

#### Example Request
```javascript
const contents = await readDirRecursive('/path/to/directory');
console.log(contents);
```

#### Response Schema
```json
{
  "files": ["file1.js", "file2.js"],
  "directories": ["dir1", "dir2"]
}
```

## Error Handling and Status Codes

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request:

- **200 OK**: The request was successful.
- **400 Bad Request**: The request was invalid.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: An unexpected error occurred on the server.

### Error Response Schema
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Detailed error message."
}
```

## Rate Limiting and Usage Guidelines

Currently, there are no rate limits imposed on the Mastro API. However, it is recommended to implement throttling in client applications to avoid overwhelming the server.

## SDK/Client Library Information

Mastro does not currently provide an official SDK. However, developers can easily integrate with the API using standard HTTP libraries available in various programming languages.

### Example in JavaScript
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

async function fetchData() {
  const response = await axios.get('http://api.mastro.com/scanRecursive');
  console.log(response.data);
}
```

### Example in Python
```python
import requests

response = requests.get('http://api.mastro.com/scanRecursive')
print(response.json())
```

## Testing and Development Guidelines

- **Local Development**: Set up a local environment using Node.js and TypeScript. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
- **Testing**: Use Jest or Mocha for unit testing. Ensure all tests pass before deploying changes.
- **Documentation**: Keep documentation updated with any changes to the API. Use tools like Swagger for generating interactive API documentation.

### Example Test Case
```javascript
test('scanRecursive returns expected structure', () => {
  const result = scanRecursive('/test/path');
  expect(result).toHaveProperty('files');
  expect(result).toHaveProperty('directories');
});
```

## Conclusion

The Mastro API is designed to be intuitive and easy to integrate. By following the guidelines and examples provided in this documentation, developers can effectively utilize the API to enhance their applications.
